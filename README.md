# thesis-template
Latex template for PhD thesis

Note: for simplicity, only one empty page is inserted at page break after the title page. One can manually insert blank pages using 
```
\newpage\null\thispagestyle{empty}\newpage
``` 
(as shown in the example) to avoid chapters starting from even page numbers.
